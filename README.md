## Introduction

I struggled to fall alseep easily for a while, and after being recommended journaling I found that it helped me immensely. The one catch was that I didn't like writing in a physical journal, since I would be greeted by all of my previous entries and all the emotions would come flooding back.

To solve this problem, I created a simple Raspberry Pi based journal, which I could use each night, entering in the chaos of the day, locking it away once I was done

After creating this, I found that the form factor of the writerdeck was really fun to use, and began developing more apps and functions, including a Claude chat client.

#### Future plans include:
- Live coding music workspace
- Simple synthesizer
- Mixxx ASCII GUI
- Better battery management

## Sounds cool, I want to make one!

Since this is still a WIP, I don't have a full build guide just yet, but feel free to modify and use the materials that I used as a starting point.

I recently ordered a PiJuice Zero, and will update if this ends up being the best solution for battery management.

You can find STEP and STL files available in the [CAD](CAD) directory, or if you want to go spin the model around, you can check it out in Onshape [here](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/e6482d1ab00cb5a2719e37b7/w/38d6de8130338c05d74e4ecf/e/8865c15cb975933cc3691846?renderMode=0&uiState=69bdc61baa0cf63feb704019). Onshape is free to use (but all designs are public), so I encourage you to create an account and start learning about CAD!

## 3D Printing

If you want to 3D print this, you can find the STL's and 3MF files in the [CAD](CAD) directory.

Since the faceplate utilizes multicolor printing, I have included a 3MF file. If you don't have access to multicolor printing or just want a blank faceplate, the regular STL will work.

I printed everything out of PLA, with no supports, but I would assume that any material (minus TPU) would work well.

I plan to make a two part version that can fit on the bed of the Bambu Lab A1 Mini.

## Software

I have included the two scripts that I vibe coded (I know it's lazy, but I have a background as a mechanical engineer, so programming is not my strong suit).

My current setup revolves around using 3 virtual terminals:
1. Standard terminal
2. Claude chat
3. Journal

I will soon add on a little tutorial file on how to enable 3 different terminals. There are also a few other tweaks I made, such as disabling login text for a cleaner UI experience.

I have tried to keep everything as minimal and light as possible, so the scripts require Python and the Anthropic API packages to run.

## Issues

The OLED screen that I sourced arrived crooked, meaning that I had to adjust the mounting holes on the screen holder. I plan to make the holes larger and incorporate washers to accomodate for this discrepancy.

The battery life sucks right now, and the power switch does a full power cycle when flipped. Hopefully with the PiJuice Zero I can integrate a sleep mode.

## TODO

- [x] Create Github repo
- [x] Record demo for Youtube
- [ ] Integrate PiJuice power hat
- [ ] Integrate I2S audio hat
- [ ] Clean up wiring (custom PCB?)
